## Application purpose
I've created this repository to pratice more from react web development, production environment bug solutions and how they behave on multiples browsers.
<br/><br/>


## If you want to run the project locally
Simple as you might be thinking, just click on each moving segment and try to match the pictures, click on 'Reset Game' to try again
<br/><br/>


## What i've used?
Mainly React, alongside with react-icons and styled-components libs
<br/><br/>


## What i've learned
This is the first project that i've created without using vanilla css or sass, just with styled-components.
I found it's a bit slower to code imho, but on the other side, same as react, its reusable and each components with his own style, make the things easier to maintain
