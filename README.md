## Application purpose
I've created this repository to pratice more from react web development, production environment bug solutions and how they behave on multiples browsers.
<br/><br/>


## If you want to take a look
https://paulomonezi.github.io/react-financial-control/ (this application use your browser local storage, so if you close it and re-open, you'll not lose the information :)
<br/><br/>


## What i've used?
Mainly React, alongside with react-icons and styled-components libs
<br/><br/>


## What i've learned
This is the first project that i've created without using vanilla css or sass, just with styled-components.
I found it's a bit slower to code imho, but on the other side, same as react, its reusable and each components with his own style, make the things easier to maintain
